My IoT system employs advanced sensors and MQTT connectivity to gather real-time vehicle data. It integrates accelerometers, ultrasonic sensors, and temperature sensors to monitor fuel efficiency, health, and safety. This data is swiftly transmitted for uninterrupted access via mobile apps and web platforms like Thingsboard, enabling informed decisions. It provides real-time collision alerts and proactive maintenance notifications for reduced breakdown risks. Additionally, it enhances efficiency by tracking driving habits and fuel consumption metrics, leading to reduced emissions. The system supports remote monitoring, offering peace of mind to vehicle owners and fleet management, ensuring enhanced safety, efficiency, proactive maintenance, and remote monitoring via advanced sensor technology and IoT connectivity.
